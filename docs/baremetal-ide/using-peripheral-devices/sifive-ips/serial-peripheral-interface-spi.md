# Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI)

## Introduction

The SPI interface can be used to communicate with external devices using the SPI protocol.&#x20;

The serial peripheral interface (SPI) protocol supports half-duplex, full-duplex and simplex synchronous, serial communication with external devices. The interface can be configured as master and in this case it provides the communication clock (SCLK) to the external slave device.



## SPI main features

* Master or slave operation
* Full-duplex synchronous transfers
* 4 to 16-bit data size selection
* Master mode baud rate prescalers up to fPCLK/2
* NSS management by hardware or software for both master and slave: dynamic change of master/slave operations
* Programmable clock polarity and phase
* Programmable data order with MSB-first or LSB-first shifting
* Dedicated transmission and reception flags with interrupt capability
* SPI bus busy status flag
* Two 32-bit embedded Rx and Tx FIFOs with DMA capability
